# Bookora - Product Requirements Document

## 1\. Overview

**App Name:** Bookora

Bookora is a comprehensive appointment booking Progressive Web App (PWA) that connects service providers with customers seeking various services such as salons, barbershops, spas, and other personal care businesses. The platform enables users to discover local businesses, view services and availability, and book appointments seamlessly through a mobile-optimized interface. Business owners can manage their services, schedules, and customer appointments while sharing their booking links for direct customer access.

The target audience includes service-seeking customers who value convenience and efficiency in booking appointments, and service providers (salons, barbershops, spas, etc.) who want to streamline their booking process and reduce no-shows through automated notifications. The app solves the problem of inefficient appointment scheduling, missed appointments, and the lack of a centralized platform for service discovery and booking.
